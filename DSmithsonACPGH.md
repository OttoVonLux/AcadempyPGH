##Creating A Design Portfolio

Creating a **Design Portfolio** sounds like an easy task, it isn’t. When faced with this essential milestone, one has a list of things to consider.

1.	What are my best works?
2.	What are my second best works?
3.	Which from the choices should I put in my portfolio?
4.	In what order should I put them?
5.	How will I design my portfolio?
6.	What medium will I use?
7.	How will this fit in with my current self-branding?

These are all questions a person will to ask him or herself in this task.

It is important to know what your __*Personal Brand Identity*__ is before you start this task, most will already know.
__*"Presenting your work is presenting yourself"*__ or some variance is uttered over and over again in design courses, and its a really good bit of wisdom to follow.

A design portfolio should not include all your best works that is not to say it should include your worst.  Your design portfolio should have a range of Best to Not the worst. The reason for this is that you want to give you potential employer a good idea of your real range.  

If you were to only give them your best work… Then you might find yourself seated with a tough project on day one, that you may not be prepared for and thus possibly disappoint your employer. You want to start at the low end of comfortable, just outside your comfort zone, but not in the next town over.
