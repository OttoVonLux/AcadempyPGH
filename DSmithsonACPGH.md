##Creating A Design Portfolio
###By Daniel Smithson,

Creating a **Design Portfolio** sounds like an easy task, it isn’t. When faced with this essential milestone, one has a list of things to consider.

1.	What are my best works?
2.	What are my second best works?
3.	Which from the choices should I put in my portfolio?
4.	In what order should I put them?
5.	How will I design my portfolio?
6.	What medium will I use?
7.	How will this fit in with my current self-branding?

These are all questions a person will to ask him or herself in this task.

It is imperative to know what your __*Personal Brand Identity*__ is before you start this task, most will already know.
__*"Presenting your work is presenting yourself"*__ or some variance is uttered over and over again in design courses, and its a really good bit of wisdom to follow.

###*Best Practices*

**A design portfolio should not include only your best works**; that is not to say it should include your worst.  Your design portfolio should have a range of Best to Not the worst. The reason for this is that you want to give you potential employer a good idea of your real range.  

If you were to only give them your best work, then you might find yourself seated with a tough project on day one, that you may not be prepared for and thus, possibly, disappoint your employer. You want to start at the low end of comfortable, just outside your comfort zone, but not in the next town over.

The next step is describing, or writing about each project.  Your work will speak to you **end product* ability, and will showcase you creative ability, but most of the companies doing the hiring are going to want to see you technical ability.  

Being able to fluidly, passionately and technically talk about you design and being able to either justify or explain you design choices and technique will give potential employers a better exposure to your ability as a professional designer.

Ben Blumenfield at Co.Design gave this list of best comment practices when creating a portfolio.

“ Make sure to include the following information for each project where appropriate:

1. **Project Background:** Set the context for the project. What was the goal of the project? What were your constraints? What was the timeline?

2. **Team and your role:** What was your explicit role, what did you uniquely contribute and who did you work with?

3. **The Work:** Go deep to show what you produced. Research, sketches, wireframes, mocks, and a link to working site or application if possible.

4. **Success Metrics:** Why are you showing me this project? Do you have any results that show this project achieved its intended goal?

5. **What You Would Have Done Differently: **Based on the process and outcome is there anything you learned you would have done differently? This is a great way to show growth and introspection.”

Being able to discuss you creative process fluidly shows strong design skill over all.
