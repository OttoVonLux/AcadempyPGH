Creating a **Design Portfolio** sounds like an easy task, it isnâ€™t. When faced with this essential milestone, one has a list of things to consider.

1.	What are my best works?
2.	What are my second best works?
3.	Which from the choices should I put in my portfolio?
4.	In what order should I put them?
5.	How will I design my portfolio?
6.	What medium will I use?

These are all questions a person has to ask him or herself in this task.
